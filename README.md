This is the final project for St. Olaf CS333 Theory of Computation which consists of creating a full GUI implementation for a Turing Machine.

## Implementation

### Tools
Angular.js, C++, Golang

### Description

There are 3 parts to this Turing Machine implementation.

| 	Component   | Implementation Description 	                                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Front-End  | HTML/CSS/Angular.js (borrowed heavily from [jsflap](https://github.com/bgrawi/jsflap) |
| Webserver | Golang |
| TM Logic | C++ |

### Turing Machine Logic
To run this, you need to go into source, and build TM.cpp (you will need to pass std=c++11, std=c++14, or std=c++17, since this C++ program uses newer STL features like tuples).

Example compile configuration (should work in GCC or Clang)
```
g++ -std=c++11 -o TM TM.cpp
```

Essentially, the C++ program is the Turing Machine logic that is able to read the format in the following format:

```
7
0d1
q

R
d 1 1
d 0 6
d 1 4

R
0 1 1
d -1 2
1 1 1

R
d -1 3
_
_

R
0 -1 3
d 1 0
1 1 3

R
0 1 4
d -1 5
1 1 4

R
_
_
d -1 3

A
_
_
_
```

The very first line defines how many states there are. The second line is the unique set of alphabets that represent potential read/write operations. The third line is the rejection char.

Then each subsequent block of text represents a state (there should be 7 in the above case [0-6, zero-indexed]). The first line on every block will say R or A (based on if the state is an Accept state or not). Every line after the first in a block represents in order the transition state for the corresponding alphabet definition in line 2. (For the above example, in every block, line 2 corresponds to what happens when you read a 0, line 3 corresponds to what happens when you read a d, line 4 corresponds to what happens when you read a 1). 

In every defining a transition, there will be 3 chars. The first char represents the write value (In the above example, if the first char of line 2 in a block is d [delta], then the transition is to write a d when it sees a 1). The second char is either 1, 0, or -1, and represents the R/S/L operation of moving the head of the input string. The 3rd char is the next state to go to after doing the operation.

### Webserver
Next, you need to run the webserver which is written in Golang. 

```
go build main.go
```

Then to run the entire thing, run “./main”, and access the webinterface by going to localhost:3000 on your browser of choice.

The webserver takes the modified TM definition (as defined by the original FA creator in (jsflap)[https://github.com/bgrawi/jsflap))

(Something like this)

```
NFA:({0dR, ddL, 0dL, 1dR, 1dL, 00R, 11R, 00L, 11L, ddS}, {q0, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6}, {(q0, q1, 0dR), (q1, q2, ddL), (q2, q3, 0dL), (q0, q4, 1dR), (q4, q5, ddL), (q5, q3, 1dL), (q1, q1, 00R), (q1, q1, 11R), (q3, q3, 00L), (q3, q3, 11L), (q4, q4, 00R), (q4, q4, 11R), (q0, q6, ddS)}, q0, {q6})
```

And converts it into a text file that can be read by the C++ program in order to define the Turing Machine (description of the file in the [Turing Machine Logic Section](### Turing Machine Logic).

Furthermore, in The Test Input section runs an Ajax call to the webserver which run the C++ program by running a shell process supplying the correct TM definition (TM.txt) and then the test input string. I modified the acceptace/rejection portion of the javascript to reflect this.

### [Main GUI Logic](source/public/)
This implementation is a lightly modified version of [jsflap](https://github.com/bgrawi/jsflap) by @bgrawi. The vast majority of this beautiful UI is of his own making, and my tweaks were only some modifications on his original Angular.js code.
